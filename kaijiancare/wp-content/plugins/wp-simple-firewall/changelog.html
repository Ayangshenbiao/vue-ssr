<p><strong>(v.0)</strong>  NEW FEATURE:   ‘FABLE’ - <a href="https://icwp.io/wpsf27">Fully Automatic Black Listing Engine</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, FABLE will automatically block all malicious traffic by IP, based on their activity. This Security Plugin will track malicious behaviour<br>
and count all transgressions that visitors make against the site.  Once a particular visitor exceeds the specified number transgressions, FABLE<br>
will outright block any access they have to your WordPress site.</p>
<p>What makes the FABLE system better?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands Free - Automatic. No more need for maintaining manual black lists.</li>
<li>Loads first before other plugins.</li>
<li>Automatic pruning. Based on expiration time you specify, older IP address will be removed.</li>
<li>Increased Performance. With automatic pruning, IP look-up tables remain small and concise so page load times for legitimate visitors is minimally affected.</li>
<li>Adaptive. It wont just block based on 1 misdemeanour - instead you may allow any given visitor grace to legitimately get things wrong (like login passwords).</li>
<li>Intelligent. With an fully integrated plugin such as this, it uses login failure attempts, spam comment attempts, login brute force attempts to capture malicious visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which actions will trigger an ABLE transgression?</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempt to login with an invalid username/password combination</li>
<li>Any attempt to login while the login cooldown system is in-effect</li>
<li>Any login attempt that trips the GASP Login protection system</li>
